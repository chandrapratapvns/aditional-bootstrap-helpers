# aditional-bootstrap-helpers
goal to set this repository to provide webdesigners and developers more simplified version of helper classes to be used in html page development.
offenly we have seen that in a html development project we use same type of css attributes multiple times if we did not set a plan before html development this file is to reduce css code and duplicacy and to ensure inheritance continued in entier html development cycle.
